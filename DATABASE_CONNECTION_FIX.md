# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Problem Resolved ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Backend container showing "restarting unhealthy" with database connection error:

```
‚ùå Error during database connection: Error: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN asco0sowgcog8c040k0gsw4c
```

## Root Cause

The backend service couldn't resolve the database hostname `asco0sowgcog8c040k0gsw4c` (Coolify-generated name), indicating:

1. Network connectivity issues between services
2. Incorrect DATABASE_URL configuration
3. Services not on the same Docker network

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Network Configuration

**Updated `docker-compose.backend.yml`**:

```yaml
networks:
  - app-network
  - coolify      # Added Coolify's external network

networks:
  coolify:
    external: true  # Connect to Coolify's network
```

### 2. Improved Health Check

**Enhanced `/health` endpoint**:

- Better database initialization checks
- Detailed debug information
- More resilient error handling
- Longer startup grace period (60s)

### 3. Extended Health Check Timing

**Updated Docker health check**:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  start_period: 60s # Was 40s
  retries: 5 # Was 3
```

## Key Fixes

### Network Connectivity

- Backend now connects to Coolify's external network
- Enables communication with database service
- Resolves hostname resolution issues

### Health Check Debugging

The `/health` endpoint now shows:

```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "debug": {
    "database_url": "set",
    "error_code": "EAI_AGAIN",
    "hostname": "problematic-hostname"
  }
}
```

### Resilient Startup

- Longer grace period for database connectivity
- More retry attempts
- Better error reporting

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Verify DATABASE_URL

Check your Coolify environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@YOUR_DB_SERVICE_NAME:5432/pickleballloveall
```

### 2. Find Correct Database Service Name

In Coolify:

1. Go to your database service
2. Note the service name/hostname
3. Use that in your DATABASE_URL

### 3. Deploy Updated Backend

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Redeploy backend service in Coolify
3. Monitor the health endpoint

### 4. Verify Connection

- Visit: `https://your-backend/health`
- Should show: `"database": "connected"`

## Files Updated

- ‚úÖ `docker-compose.backend.yml` - Added Coolify network
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/routes/health.ts` - Enhanced debugging
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive guide
- ‚úÖ `COOLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Added troubleshooting section

## Expected Result

After deploying these changes:

1. **Backend starts successfully** ‚úÖ
2. **Database connection established** ‚úÖ
3. **Health check passes** ‚úÖ
4. **Container stops restarting** ‚úÖ

The `EAI_AGAIN` error should be resolved! üéâ
