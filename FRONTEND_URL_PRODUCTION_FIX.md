# üöÄ Frontend Production URL Fix - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Vite Development Proxy Issue**

**Problem**: Vite proxy was hardcoded to `localhost:3001` and was active in production builds.
**Solution**: Modified `vite.config.ts` to only enable proxy in development mode.

### 2. **Environment Variables Not Working During Build**

**Problem**: Vite needs environment variables during build time, not runtime.
**Solution**:

- Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` to accept build arguments
- Updated `docker-compose.app.yml` to pass environment variables as build args
- Environment variables are now baked into the build

### 3. **Direct Fetch Calls Bypassing Configuration**

**Problem**: `Profile.tsx` had direct `fetch()` calls using relative URLs (`/api/...`) which used the Vite proxy.
**Solution**:

- Created `utils/api.ts` helper for authenticated fetch calls
- Replaced direct fetch calls with helper function that uses production API URL

### 4. **Backend Port Mismatch**

**Problem**: Backend was defaulting to port 3001 instead of 3000.
**Solution**: Updated default port in `backend/src/index.ts` and `backend/src/scripts/start.ts`

## ‚úÖ Verification Results

### Build Test Results:

```bash
# Built with production environment variables:
VITE_API_URL=http://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io/api
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_WS_URL=wss://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io

# ‚úÖ Production URLs found in final build:
VITE_API_URL:"http://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io/api"
VITE_WS_URL:"wss://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io"

# ‚úÖ Environment config in build:
wd={apiUrl:"http://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io/api",environment:"production"}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps for Coolify

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Coolify:

**Frontend Service:**

```
VITE_API_URL=http://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io/api
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_WS_URL=wss://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io
```

**Backend Service:**

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=https://qw80so04oc0wkcwg0cw8woko.46.202.89.24.sslip.io
JWT_SECRET=[your-secret-key]
DATABASE_URL=[your-database-url]
```

### 2. Force Rebuild to Apply Changes:

```bash
# In Coolify, trigger a new deployment with --no-cache
# This ensures frontend is built with production environment variables
```

### 3. Expected Results:

- ‚úÖ No more `localhost:3001` in network requests
- ‚úÖ API calls go to production backend
- ‚úÖ CORS errors resolved
- ‚úÖ All features work in production

## üîç Key Technical Changes

### Updated Files:

1. `frontend/Dockerfile` - Added build args for environment variables
2. `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Proxy only in development mode
3. `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` - Helper for authenticated fetch calls
4. `frontend/src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Replaced direct fetch calls
5. `docker-compose.app.yml` - Added build args for frontend
6. `backend/src/index.ts` - Fixed default port to 3000
7. `backend/src/scripts/start.ts` - Fixed default port to 3000

### Architecture Fix:

- **Before**: Frontend used Vite proxy pointing to localhost:3001 even in production
- **After**: Frontend uses environment-specific API URLs baked into the build

## üéØ The Root Cause

The main issue was that **Vite environment variables must be available during the Docker build process**, not just at container runtime. The previous setup was trying to set environment variables at runtime, but the frontend was already built with default localhost values.

**This fix ensures your frontend will connect to the production API URL instead of localhost:3001.**
