# Tournament Organizer Permission Security Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Security Problem:** Organizers could update scores for ANY tournament, not just tournaments they created.

**Root Cause:** Frontend `canUpdateScore()` function checked `user.role === "organizer"` without verifying tournament ownership.

## Solution Applied

Updated the permission logic to ensure organizers can only update scores for tournaments they own.

### Before (Security Issue)

```typescript
// ❌ SECURITY ISSUE: Any organizer could update any match scores
if (user.role === "organizer") {
  return true;
}
```

### After (Secure)

```typescript
// ✅ SECURE: Only tournament owner can update match scores
if (
  user.role === "organizer" &&
  tournament &&
  tournament.organizerId === user.id
) {
  return true;
}
```

## Updated Permission Matrix

| User Type                    | Can Update Scores For                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tournament Organizer**     | ✅ Only their own tournament matches                       |
| **Match Players**            | ✅ Only matches they are playing in                        |
| **Authorized Score Keepers** | ✅ Only matches they are authorized for                    |
| **Other Organizers**         | ❌ Cannot update scores for tournaments they didn't create |
| **Viewers/Others**           | ❌ Cannot update any scores                                |

## File Changed

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/TournamentDetails.tsx`
**Function:** `canUpdateScore()`
**Change:** Added tournament ownership check for organizers

## Backend Security

The backend was already secure and correctly implemented:

```typescript
// ✅ Backend was already checking tournament ownership correctly
if (tournament.organizerId === userId) {
  return { allowed: true };
}
```

## Other Components Verified

All other organizer permission checks were already properly implemented:

### TournamentDetails.tsx

```typescript
// ✅ Already correct
const isOrganizer = user?.id === tournament?.organizerId;
```

### TournamentBracket.tsx

```typescript
// ✅ Already correct
const isOrganizer = tournament && user && tournament.organizerId === user.id;
```

### MatchManagementModal.tsx

```typescript
// ✅ Already correct - receives isOrganizer prop from parent
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works correctly:

### Test Case 1: Tournament Owner

1. Login as organizer who created Tournament A
2. Navigate to Tournament A matches
3. ✅ Should see "Update Score" buttons
4. ✅ Should be able to update scores

### Test Case 2: Different Organizer

1. Login as organizer who created Tournament B
2. Navigate to Tournament A matches (created by different organizer)
3. ❌ Should NOT see "Update Score" buttons
4. ❌ Should NOT be able to update scores

### Test Case 3: Players

1. Login as player in a match
2. Navigate to that match
3. ✅ Should see "Update Score" button for their own match
4. ❌ Should NOT see button for matches they're not in

### Test Case 4: Score Keepers

1. Login as user who is authorized score keeper for Match X
2. Navigate to Match X
3. ✅ Should see "Update Score" button
4. ❌ Should NOT see button for other matches

## Security Impact

### Before Fix (Risk)

- ❌ **Cross-tournament access:** Any organizer could manipulate scores in tournaments they didn't create
- ❌ **Data integrity risk:** Potential for unauthorized score modifications
- ❌ **Competition fairness risk:** Malicious organizers could affect other tournaments

### After Fix (Secure)

- ✅ **Proper access control:** Organizers restricted to their own tournaments
- ✅ **Data integrity maintained:** Only authorized users can update scores
- ✅ **Competition fairness:** Tournament isolation maintained

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users only get minimum necessary permissions
2. **Resource Ownership:** Users can only modify resources they own
3. **Defense in Depth:** Both frontend and backend validate permissions
4. **Clear Authorization Logic:** Explicit checks rather than role-based assumptions

## Additional Security Considerations

This fix ensures that:

- Tournament organizers maintain full control over their tournaments
- Cross-tournament interference is prevented
- Score integrity is maintained per tournament
- Clear audit trail of who can modify what

The permission model now properly implements tournament-scoped authorization rather than global role-based access.
